Operating instructions: Run makefile


novel/significant	design	decisions: We decided to implement args in order to manage the positions of each input taken in from the user. We felt it much easier to keep track with args as well as create our own type of flags that determine if and when we need to stop the fork and piping process. 
	
Extrafeatures/algorithms/functionality: It is able to execute very fastly and accurately. Took advantage of many of the piping flags and macros to make the code more lightweight and also split into more functions to make it easier to understand instead of writing it all in main. 

	
                      

Operating instructions: Run makefile by typing make then run pam
